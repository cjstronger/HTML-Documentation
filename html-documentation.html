        <p>HTML is a front-end software language that allows one to build a website with elements. These elements are the main basis of the language, every new line starts with an element and ends with one. It is very basic on its own but when paired with other styling tools like CSS it can become an art.</p>
        <p>The elements are very user-friendly, they make reading code very easy. The understandabilty of HTML makes it so reading the code allows the user to see what might end up where and the flow of the page. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A body element is what holds all of your pages content and a section element is used as a separation piece to separate individual elements in the body.</li>
          <li>HTML is also coded with a new element per line and the elements themselves are colored and indented in a way to understand where one ends and starts</li>
        </ul>

        <header>What you should already know and have</header>
        <p>This guide assumes you already know and have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
          <li>A text-editor of some sort, I recommend VSCode for beginners as most engineers use it and it has the most extensions to enable a load of customization. Other wanna-be sigma's would recommend Vim.. you do you.</li>

        <header>HTML and CSS</header>
        <p>HTML and CSS are like to peas in a pod, they were made for each other. HTML provides the code to allow CSS to manipulate those itemes into looking a different way.</p>
        <p>HTML is the backbone of the web and is used to define the structure of web pages, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other elements. Even websites built with more advanced technologies like JavaScript frameworks or content management systems (CMS) ultimately rely on HTML to render content in web browsers</p>
        <p>Virtually all modern websites utilize CSS to some extent to control the visual presentation and layout of their content. CSS allows web developers to define styles such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, and positioning, which are applied to HTML elements to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages.</p>
      </section>
      <section id='Hello_World' class='main-section'>
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>To get started with writing HTML open your text-editor and input an opening <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. All elements start with a less than sign (opening tag) and end with a greater than sign (closing tag). Close the html element with the same setup used with a opening element but use a slash after the opening tag.</p>
        <p>Once your code looks like the following:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Enter an opening and closing h1 element and in-between those, type the text 'Hello World'. Your code should look like the following:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>&lt;html&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>After you've typed your code, use the terminal tab in VSCode to start your code into your browser. I saved my file as 'test.html' so input for the terminal will be 'start test.html'. Hit enter, VSCode will ask your browser and Voila! See how easy that was?</p>
      </section>
      <section id="The_h's" class='main-section'>
        <header>The h's</header>
        <p>In HTML, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> elements are used to define headings of different levels, where <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> represents the highest level of heading and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> represents the lowest level of heading.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>These elements represent headings of different levels, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the highest level (most important) and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> being the lowest level (least important).</li>
          <li>Headings form a hierarchical structure, where <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is typically used for the main heading or title of the page, and subsequent headings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;</code>, etc.) are used for subheadings or sections within the page.</li>
          <li>By default, browsers display headings with larger font sizes and more prominent styling to visually differentiate them from regular text. As you go down the ladder of the h's the font size decreases. However, the exact styling can be modified using CSS to match the design of the website.</li>
